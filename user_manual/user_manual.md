<br>
![searchbar image](user_manual/images/searchbar.JPG)
###### *_Fig. 1.2. Entering the Brexit Analysis URL_*

<br>
![homepage image](user_manual/images/homepage.png)
###### *_Fig. 1.3. Brexit Analysis Homepage_*
<br>

### 2. Brexit Analysis Webpage
Here, you can see the following headings in the navigation bar at the top of the
page - the contents of which will be explained in full detail in later paragraphs:
- Home
- UK and Ireland 
- International 
- About
- Contact

#### **2.1. Home**
Here, you can see examples of the various graph options and the various data results displayed by them. This data is regularly updated and refreshed by our
back-end database so returning to the home page at a later time (e.g. an hour or
two later) will result in a change in the data displayed.
<br>

To return to the homepage at any time, you can click 'Home' in the navigation bar or click the Brexit Analysis logo in the top-left corner of the page as demonstrated below:
<br>
![return home image](user_manual/images/returnhome.png)
##### *_Fig 2.1. Returning to the main page_*

#### **2.2. UK and Ireland Tweets**
Here, users can input search parameters via a HTML form in order to query data from our back-end database. <br>
This retrieved data can then be displayed visually via their selected chart - i.e. pie chart, bar chart, etc.<br>

At the top of this search page is a brief set of instructions:
<br>
![return home image](user_manual/images/uk-ire-search-instructions.png)
##### *_Fig. 2.2.1. UK Tweet Search instructions_*
<br>

The search parameters are as follows:
- Search by String
- Region*
- Sentiment*
- Stance*

_*Region, Sentiment and Stance are dropdown menus whose options appear to the user once clicked._

**NB:** _The user must select 'Split By' for one and **only** one of the dropdown search parameters in order to query data within the database by a particular attribute group.<br>
Essentially, the search must be grouped by either region, sentiment or stance before specifying a particular location, sentiment value or political leaning._<br>

An example is provided below where a user is searching for the percentage result of tweets **split by** country.<br>
They have narrowed their search by selecting to search for tweets that are positive and Pro-Brexit.

![searching-the-uk-ire-page image](user_manual/images/searching-uk-ire-page.png)
##### *_Fig. 2.2.2. Specifying a search for UK and Ireland Tweets_*
<br>

##### **2.2.1. Search by String**
The search box provided on this page allows users to enter any particular string - e.g. 'Scottish Independence', 'Irexit', etc. - in order to view the total percentage of tweets containing this string.
This is an optional parameter which can be included by the user into their search query at their discretion.

##### **2.2.2. Region**
This search parameter requires users to select a location against which to base their search query and retrieve data from the database.<br>
The region parameter allows users to specify the location from which they wish to view the percentage of tweets with a particular stance or of a particular sentiment or both.<br>
The locations in question are the Republic of Ireland and the four central regions which compose the UK - i.e. England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.

##### **2.2.3. Sentiment**
This parameter allows users to search for tweets whose text is of a particular sentiment - i.e. positive, negative or neutral.<br>
Users can also opt to query all sentiment values via the _'Split By'_ option or select an assortment of values via the _'No Preference'_ option.

##### **2.2.4. Stance**
Stance here primarily refers to the two political options with regards to the collected tweets and the Brexit referendum - namely that of tweets with hashtags affiliated with the Leave campaign (Pro-Brexit) and those containing hashtags affiliated with the Remain campaign (Pro-Stay).<br>
Similarly to the Sentiment options, users can choose to view the data results from tweets of both political sides via the _'Split By'_ option.

##### **2.2.5. Choosing a Chart**
Users can pass their chosen parameters to the database by selecting a particular chart as seen below:
![choosing a chart image](user_manual/images/choosing-a-chart.png)
##### *_Fig. 2.2.3. Choosing a chart_*
<br>

#### **2.3. International Tweets**
In similar fashion to the UK and Ireland page, there is also a small paragraph at the top centre of the detail with instructions on how to utilise the graphs (see Fig. 2.3.1)
<br>
![return home image](user_manual/images/int-search-instructions.png)
###### _Fig. 2.3.1. International Search Page instructions_
<br>

**_NB: In contrast to the UK and Ireland page, users must select a 'Split By' value from either the Sentiment or Stance menu._**<br>
Please review section 2.2. for details of choosing parameters and selecting a chart as the International page follows the same methodology.

##### **2.3.1. Country**
Here the Countries menu works in a similar fashion to that of the UK/Ireland Regions menu.<br> 
Once clicked, a dropdown menu with all provided options will appear to the user.<br>
However, the countries in question are a list of 224 international countries which do not belong to the UK or Ireland.

#### **2.4. About**
This page provides users with background information with regard to Brexit Analysis as a whole.

#### **2.5. Contact**
This page allows users to send an email to the admin of Brexit Analysis.<br>
Users are required to provide a valid name and email and will then write their query into the message box on-screen.<br>
To submit the form, press submit.
<br>
![contact page image](user_manual/images/contact-page.png)
###### *_Fig. 2.5.1. Filling in the Contact Form_*
<br>

Once successful, you will be redirected to a confirmation page that will display the message, "Thank You! Your query has been received!"
<br>
![query sent image](user_manual/images/query-sent.png)
<br>
Users can then use the navigation bar to return to a different page of the website.

### 3. Ending a Session
To end a session, simply click the red 'X' button in the corner of the browser screen.
